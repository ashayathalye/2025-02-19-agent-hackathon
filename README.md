# Agent Hackathon

## To figure out potentially in parallel

- "Wait for input"
    - Could explore this in the context of a simple self-contained demo, getting the AI to coordinate a meeting between two people
    - Use a tool that is implemented as just `input()` to get any next input from the environment (kind of like [`select(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html)
- Twilio integration (low priority)
- Multimodal or separate OCR integration (receipt -> text)
    - Look into smolagents `images` or `additional_args` arguments
